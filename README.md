Reinforcement Learning Introduction

# Coding Challenge - Due Date, Thursday December 30 2017, 12 PM PST \

This weeks coding challenge is to use Monte Carlo Prediction to help a bot navigate an RL world. Use [this](https://github.com/dennybritz/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/MC/) as a guide and use OpenAI's gym environment. Bonus points for good documentation, good luck! 



## Overview
This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/5R2vErZn0yw) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the "Introduction to AI for Video Games" series. We're going to compare and contrast policy and value iteration algorithms. Both are a type of dynamic programming. 

## Dependencies

* numpy 
* openAI's gym https://github.com/openai/gym

## Usage

Just run 'python frozen_lake.py' in terminal

## Credits

Credits for this code go to [root-ua](https://github.com/root-ua). I've merely created a wrapper to get people started.
